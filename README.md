# Seller-Considerations-for-Condo-Price-

This analysis investigates the relationship between condominium sale price, and the independent variables height of the unit (floor number), distance of the unit from the elevator, presence, or absence of an ocean view and whether the unit is an end unit from a seller’s perspective. This is accomplished by finding a statistical model that best describes the observed data and utilize this model to investigate how the seller’s fixed price is influenced by the independent variables.
